Practicing Java and DDD

## How many things we need to care

This is a nice project for me. I am practicing DDD inside a hexagonal architecture, using Java as main language and
Spring boot as the service framework.

- hexagonal architecture expressed trough folders
- DDD started with event storming technique
- spring boot project started from initializr
- two modules to encapsulate external dependencies and keep core pure
- docker for postgres database dev creation
- flyway to database migration
- jsonb to store cart items on database
- sonarqube on multiple module project
- github actions to run checks and sonarqube
- coverage with jacoco
- actuator to health check endpoints
